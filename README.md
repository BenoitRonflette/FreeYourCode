**json-io** consists of two main classes, a reader (`JsonReader`) and a writer (`JsonWriter`).  **json-io** eliminates the need for using `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream` to serialize Java and instead uses the JSON format.  There is a 3rd optional class (`JsonObject`) see 'Non-typed Usage' below.

**json-io** does not require that Java classes implement `Serializable` or `Externalizable` to be serialized, unlike `ObjectInputStream` / `ObjectOutputStream`.  It will serialize any Java object graph into JSON and retain complete graph semantics / shape and object types.  This includes supporting private fields, private inner classes (static or non-static), of any depth.  It also includes handling cyclic references.  Objects do not need to have public constructors to be serialized.  The output JSON will not include `transient` fields, identical to the ObjectOutputStream behavior.

The `JsonReader / JsonWriter` code does not depend on any native or 3rd party libraries.

### Format
**json-io** uses proper JSON format.  As little type information is included in the JSON format to keep it compact as possible.  When an object's class can be inferred from a field type or array type, the object's type information is left out of the stream.  For example, a `String[]` looks like `["abc", "xyz"]`.

When an object's type must be emitted, it is emitted as a meta-object field `"@type":"package.class"` in the object.  When read, this tells the JsonReader what class to instantiate.

If an object is referenced more than once, or references an object that has not yet been defined, (say A points to B, and B points to C, and C points to A), it emits a `"@ref":n` where 'n' is the object's integer identity (with a corresponding meta entry `"@id":n` defined on the referenced object).  Only referenced objects have IDs in the JSON output, reducing the JSON String length.

### Performance
**json-io** was written with performance in mind.  In most cases **json-io** is faster than the JDK's `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream`.  As the tests run, a log is written of the time it takes to serialize / deserialize and compares it to `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream` (if the static variable `_debug` is `true` in `TestUtil`).

### Usage
**json-io** can be used directly on JSON Strings or with Java's Streams.

_Example 1: String to Java object_

    Object obj = JsonReader.jsonToJava("[\"Hello, World\"]");

This will convert the JSON String to a Java Object graph.  In this case, it would consist of an `Object[]` of one `String` element.

_Example 2: Java object to JSON String_

    Employee emp;
    // Emp fetched from database
    String json = JsonWriter.objectToJson(emp);

This example will convert the `Employee` instance to a JSON String.  If the `JsonReader` were used on this `String`, it would reconstitute a Java `Employee` instance.

_Example 3: `InputStream` to Java object_

    JsonReader jr = new JsonReader(inputStream);
    Employee emp = (Employee) jr.readObject();

In this example, an `InputStream` (could be from a File, the Network, etc.) is supplying an unknown amount of JSON.  The `JsonReader` is used to wrap the stream to parse it, and return the Java object graph it represents.

_Example 4: Java Object to `OutputStream`_

    Employee emp;
    // emp obtained from database
    JsonWriter jw = new JsonWriter(outputStream);
    jw.write(emp);
    jw.close();

In this example, a Java object is written to an output stream in JSON format.

### Non-typed Usage
**json-io** provides the choice to use the generic "Map of Maps" representation of an object, akin to a Javascript associative array.  When reading from a JSON String or `InputStream` of JSON, the `JsonReader` can be constructed like this:

    Map graph = JsonReader.jsonToMaps(String json);

-- or --

    JsonReader jr = new JsonReader(InputStream, true);
    Map map = (Map) jr.readObject();

This will return an untyped object representation of the JSON String as a `Map` of Maps, where the fields are the `Map` keys (Strings), and the field values are the associated Map's values. In this representation the `Map` instance returned is actually a `JsonObject` instance (from **json-io**).  This `JsonObject` implements the `Map` interface permitting access to the entire object.  Cast to a `JsonObject`, you can see the type information, position within the JSON stream, and other information.

This 'Maps' representation can be re-written to a JSON String or Stream and _the output JSON will exactly match the original input JSON stream_.  This permits a JVM receiving JSON strings / streams that contain class references which do not exist in the JVM that is parsing the JSON, to completely read / write the stream.  Additionally, the Maps can be modified before being written, and the entire graph can be re-written in one collective write.  _Any object model can be read, modified, and then re-written by a JVM that does not contain any of the classes in the JSON data!_

### Customization
New APIs have been added to allow you to associate a custom reader / writer class to a particular class if you want it to be read / written specially in the JSON output.  **json-io** 1.x required a custom method be implemented on the object which was having its JSON format customized.  This support has been removed.  That approach required access to the source code for the class being customized.  The new **json-io** 2.0 approach allows you to customize the JSON format for classes for which you do not have the source code.

#### Dates
To specify an alternative date format for `JsonWriter`:

    Map args = new HashMap();
    args.put(JsonWriter.DATE_FORMAT, JsonWriter.ISO_DATE_TIME);
    String json = JsonWriter.objectToJson(root, args);

In this example, the ISO `yyyy/MM/ddTHH:mm:ss` format is used to format dates in the JSON output. The 'value' associated to the 'DATE_FORMAT' key can be `JsonWriter.ISO_DATE_TIME`, `JsonWriter.ISO_DATE`, a date format String pattern (eg. `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm`), or a `java.text.Format` instance.

### Javascript
Included is a small Javascript utility that will take a JSON output stream created by the JSON writer and substitute all `@ref's` for the actual pointed to object.  It's a one-line call - `resolveRefs(json)`.  This will substitute `@ref` tags in the JSON for the actual pointed-to object.  In addition, the `@keys` / `@items` will also be converted into Javascript Maps and Arrays.  Finally, there is a Javascript API that will convert a full Javascript object graph to JSON, (even if it has cycles within the graph).  This will maintain the proper graph-shape when sending it from the client back to the server.

### What's next?
Even though **json-io** is perfect for Java / Javascript serialization, there are other great uses for it:

### Cloning
Many projects use `JsonWriter` to write an object to JSON, then use the `JsonReader` to read it in, perfectly cloning the original object graph:

    Employee emp;
    // emp obtained from database
    Employee deepCopy = (Employee) cloneObject(emp);

    public Object cloneObject(Object root)
    {
        return JsonReader.jsonToJava(JsonWriter.objectToJson(root));
    }

### Debugging
Instead of doing `System.out.println()` debugging, call `JsonWriter.objectToJson(obj)` and dump that String out.  It will reveal the object in all it's glory.

### Pretty-Printing JSON
Use `JsonWriter.formatJson()` API to format a passed in JSON string to a nice, human readable format.  Also, when writing JSON data, use the `JsonWriter.objectToJson(o, args)` API, where args is a `Map` with a key of `JsonWriter.PRETTY_PRINT` and a value of 'true' (`boolean` or `String`).  When run this way, the JSON written by the `JsonWriter` will be formatted in a nice, human readable format.

### RESTful support
**json-io** can be used as the fundamental data transfer method between a Javascript / JQuery / Ajax client and a web server in a RESTful fashion. Used this way, you can create more active sites like Google's GMail, MyOtherDrive online backup, etc.

See https://github.com/jdereg/json-command-servlet for a light-weight servlet that processes Ajax / XHR calls.

Featured on http://json.org.
 * 2.9.1
  * Bug fix: Parameterized types are only stamped onto generic Maps (Maps read with no @type) if the field point to the Map is a Template variable or it has template arguments.
 * 2.9.0
  * Unmodifiable `Collections` and `Maps` can now be serialized.
  * Added tests to ensure that `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` coerces the RHS values when logical primitives, to the optional associated `@type's` fields.
  * More tests and improved code-coverage.
 * 2.8.1
  * Bug fix: `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` API was incorrectly attempting to instantiate peer objects (specified by "@type" field in the JSON) when in 'maps' mode.  This made `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` fail if all referenced class names did not exist in the JVM.  This has been fixed.
  * Minor Javadoc cleanup (Daniel Darabos @darabos)
  * Began migration of tests from one monolithic Java class (`TestJsonReaderWriter`) to individual Groovy test classes.
 * 2.8.0
  * Additional attempt to instantiate classes via `sun.misc.Unsafe` added (optional must be turned on by calling `JsonReader.setUseUnsafe(true)`). json-io already tries all constructors (private or public) with varying arguments, etc.  If this fails and unsafe is true, it will try `sun.misc.Unsafe.allocateInstance()` which effectively does a C-style `malloc()`.  This is OK, because the rest of `JsonReader` fills in the member variables from the serialized content.  (Submitted by @KaiHufenbach).
 * 2.7.6
  * Performance optimizations.  Use of switch statement instead of if-else chains.
  * JDK 1.7 for source code and target JVM.
 * 2.7.5
  * Bug fix: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds could still occur when serializing a class with multiple Templated fields.  The exception has been fixed.
 * 2.7.4
  * Bug fix: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception occurring when serializing non-static inner class with nested template parameters.  JsonReader was incorrectly passing on the 'this$0' field for further template argument processing when it should not have.
 * 2.7.3
  * `JsonReader` executes faster (more efficiently manages internal 'snippet' buffer and last line and column read.)
  * Improved date parsing: day of week support (long or short name), days with suffix (3rd, 25th, etc.), Java's default `.toString()` output for `Date` now parses, full time zone support, extra whitespace allowed within the date string.
  * Added ability to have custom JSON writers for interfaces (submitted by @KaiHufenbach).
 * 2.7.2
  * When writing JSON, less memory is used to manage referenced objects.  `JsonWriter` requires a smaller memory foot print during writing.
  * New option available to JsonWriter that allows you to force enums to not write private variables.  First you can make them transient.  However, if you do not own the code or cannot change it, you can set the `JsonWriter.getArgs().put(ENUM_PUBLIC_ONLY, true)`, and then only public fields on enums will be emitted.
 * 2.7.1
  * `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` are now always written as a primitive (immutable, non-referenced) value.  This uniformizes their output.
 * 2.7.0
  * Updated to support JSON root of `String`, `Integer`, Floating point, and `Boolean`, per the updated JSON RFP.  Example, the `String` "football" is considered valid JSON.  The `JsonReader.readObject()` API and `JsonReader.jsonToJava()` will return a `String` in this case.  The `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` API will still return a `Map (JsonObject)`, and the `@items` key will contain an `Object[]` with the single value (`String, Integer, Double, Boolean`) in it.
  * When a Java `Map` has only `String` keys in it, json-io will use the JSON object keys directly and associate the values to the keys as expected.  For example, the `Map` ['Football':true] would be written `{"Football":true}`.  However, if the keys are non-Strings, then Maps will be written as a JSON object with `{"@keys":[...], "@items":[...]}`, where `@keys` is an array [] of all the keys, and the `@items` is an array [] of all the values.  Entry 0 of `@keys` matches with Entry 0 in the `@items` array, and so on.  Thanks for Christian Reuschling for making the request and then supplying the implementation.
  * Change some APIs from `private` to `protected` to allow for subclasses to more easily override the default behavior.
 * 2.6.1
  * Bug fix: An internal `Map` that kept meta-information about a Java Class, changed to `ConcurrentHashMap` from `HashMap`.
 * 2.6.0
  * Added support for specifying which fields on a class will be serialized.  Use the `JsonWriter.FIELD_SPECIFIERS` key and assign the value to a `Map<Class, List<String>>`, where the keys of the `Map` are classes (e.g. Bingo.class) and the values are `List<String>`, which indicates the fields to serialize for the class.  This provides a way to reduce the number of fields written for a given class.  For example, you may encounter a 3rd Party class which fails to serialize because it has an oddball field like a `ClassLoader` reference as a non-static, non-transient field. You may not have access to the source code to mark the field as `transient`. In this case, add the appropriate entries in the `FIELD_SPECIFIERS` map. Voila, problem solved. Use the `JsonWriter` API that takes `optionalArgs Map`.  The key for this `Map` is `JsonWriter.FIELD_SPECIFIER` and the value is `Map<Class, List<String>>`.
 * 2.5.2
  * `java.net.URL` can now be used as a constructor argument.  The reader was throwing an exception instantiating a constructor with a `URL` parameter.
  * `java.lang.Object` parameters in constructor arguments are now tried with both null and `new Object()` now.
 * 2.5.1
  * Fixed a bug (introduced in 2.5.0) in the processing of a `Map` that has a `Collection` as a key.
 * 2.5.0
  * New 'Pretty-Print' option available.  If the 'args' Map passed to `JsonWriter.objectToJson(o, args)` contains the key `JsonWriter.PRETTY_PRINT` and the value 'true' (`boolean` or `String`), the `JsonWriter` output will be formatted in a nice human readable format.
  * Convert a JSON String to Pretty-Print format using `JsonWriter.formatJson(String json)`.  A `String` will be returned with the JSON formatted in a nice, human readable format.
  * If a Field contains Parameterized types (e.g., `Map<String, Set<Long>>`, and so on), `JsonReader` will use those fields to process objects deep within Maps, Collections, etc. and still create the proper Java class.
 * 2.4.5
  * Allow "" to be set into `Date` field, setting the `Date` field (or `Date` array element) as null.
 * 2.4.4
  * Allow "" to be set into `BigInteger` or `BigDecimal` when return value is `Map` (`JsonObject`). "" to non-String fields will be null, except for primitives and primitive wrappers, that will result in JVM default value.
 * 2.4.2
  * Allow "" to be set into non-String fields, when doing so, null is set on Object type fields; on primitive fields, the JVM default value is set. This is for when converting JSON to Java objects directly.
 * 2.4.1
  * Added support to allow primitives and `String` to be assigned to abstract / interface / base type field on an object (`Serializable`, `Comparable`, `Object`, etc.). Primitives can now be 'set' into these fields, without any additional type information.
 * 2.4.0
  * Primitives can be set from `Strings`
  * `Strings` can be set from primitives
  * `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` can be set from primitives, `Strings`, `BigDecimal`, or `BigInteger`
 * 2.3.0
  * `Maps` and `Collections` (`Lists`, `Set`, etc.) can be read in, even when there are no `@keys` or `@items` as would come from a Javascript client.
  * **json-io** will now use the generic info on a `Map<Foo, Bar>` or `Collection<Foo>` object's field when the `@type` information is not included. **json-io** will then know to create `Foo` instances, `Bar` instances, etc. within the `Collection` or `Map`.
  * All parsing error messages now output the last 100 characters read, making it easier to locate the problem in JSON text. Furthermore, line and column number are now included (before it was a single position number). This allows you to immediately find the offending location.
  * You can now force `@type` to be written (not recommended) by putting the `JsonWriter.TYPE` key in the `JsonWriter` args map, and assigning the associated value to `true`.
 * 2.2.32
  * Date/Time format can be customized when writing JSON output. New optional `Map args` parameter added to main API of `JsonWriter` that specifies additional parameters for `JsonWriter`. Set the key to `JsonWriter.DATE_FORMAT` and the value to a `SimpleDateFormat` string.  Two ISO formats are available for convenience as constants on `JsonWriter`, `JsonWriter.ISO_DATE_FORMAT` and `JsonWriter.ISO_DATE_TIME_FORMAT`.
  * `JsonReader` updated to read many different date/time formats.
  * When `JsonReader` encounters a class that cannot be constructed, you can associate a `ClassFactory` to the class, so that then the un-instantiable class is encountered, your factory class will be called to create the class. New API: `JsonReader.assignInstantiator(Class c, ClassFactory factory)`
 * 2.2.31
  * Adds ability to instantiate a wider range of constructors. This was done by attempting construction with both null and non-null values for many common class types (`Collections`, `String`, `Date`, `Timezone`, etc.)
 * 2.2.30
  * `java.sql.Date` when read in, was instantiated as a `java.util.Date`. This has been corrected.
 * 2.2.29
  * First official release through Maven Central
